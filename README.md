# FinTech-Day3

### This is FinTech day three introduction to Git CLI and Markdown

### My name is Xavier Spurlock, I've had jobs ranging from General Laborer for a drilling company to Signals Intelligence Analyst for the US Army. I've never really been the best at setting goals but my current one is simple, pass the class and learn a new skill. I chose FinTech as a career path because I think it's a career that will age well. Programmers & coders will always be in demand, cyber security will become more prominent, and people will always seek advice when it comes to making large financial investments. It doesn't hurt that the career field has some decent money to be made.
